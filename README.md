This repository contains solutions to assignments from the **Elzero TypeScript Course**, designed to help developers master TypeScript from fundamentals to advanced concepts. Each assignment focuses on practical implementation of TypeScript features, ensuring hands-on learning.

## 📌 Description

The **Elzero TypeScript Course Assignments** repository is a comprehensive collection of exercises and solutions aimed at reinforcing TypeScript skills. It follows the curriculum taught in the [Elzero Web School](https://www.youtube.com/c/ElzeroInfo) TypeScript course, covering topics like type annotations, interfaces, classes, generics, decorators, and more. Each assignment is structured to challenge learners and solidify their understanding of TypeScript's static typing and modern JavaScript features.

## 🚀 Features

- **Structured Learning Path**: Assignments progress from basic to advanced topics.
- **Hands-On Practice**: Real-world problems to solve using TypeScript.
- **Detailed Solutions**: Solutions for each assignment included for reference.
- **Course Coverage**:
  - TypeScript configuration (`tsconfig.json`)
  - Data types, functions, and interfaces
  - Classes, inheritance, and access modifiers
  - Generics, decorators, and type guards
  - Advanced types (e.g., `Partial`, `Pick`, `Record`)
